# Easy Discord Plugin

## Installing

Step 1. Download the zip file, and put it's contents into your server's "/mods" directory and restart the server.

Step 2. Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1024825496799826042&permissions=274878630912&scope=bot) to invite the mindustry-chat-bot to your discord server.

Step 3. Find the discord channel you want to connect to your server and right click on it, then select "copy id". 
Note: it's recommended that you paste the id into notepad or similar, and copy it again. sometimes pasting directly into the console will not work correctly)

Step 4. In your server console, enter the following command: "setchannel PASTE_YOUR_ID_HERE" and hit enter.

Congratulations. Your server should now be connected. (Most) errors should log to your console. 

## Notes
This is slightly experimental. I have no idea the level of traffic my web server will be able to handle but please let me know any issues you come accross either by openening an issue on this reposity or on discord.
