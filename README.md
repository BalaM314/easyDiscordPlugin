# EasyDiscordPlugin

A lightweight javascript plugin that connects mindustry game chat to discord.

## Installing

Simply download the zip file, pull the folder inside of it out, and put it into your config/mods folder.
(A server restart is required to update mods/plugins on your server.).

Once your server is started, create a discord channel that will be used for game chat, right-click the cahnnel,
and click "copy ID". Then in your mindustry server console, run `setchannel <channel-id>`, and that's it!

Due to security reasons, I will need to whitelist your server's IP address to connect to the web api relay.
